# Troubleshooting Common Google Cloud Compute Engine Issues

This guide outlines common problems with Google Cloud Compute Engine, their root causes, and troubleshooting steps.

---

## **1. VM Instance Not Reachable**

### **Symptoms**:
- Unable to SSH into the instance.
- Ping or connection requests time out.

### **Reasons**:
- Firewall rules block incoming traffic.
- Instance does not have an external IP address.
- Network tags are missing or incorrect.
- Instance is stopped or terminated.
- VPC network misconfiguration.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Instance Status**:
   - Go to **Compute Engine > VM Instances** and verify the instance status (e.g., running, stopped, or terminated).
2. **Verify Firewall Rules**:
   - Ensure firewall rules allow ingress traffic for SSH (port 22) or other required ports.
   - Check the **VPC network > Firewall** section.
3. **Check External IP**:
   - Ensure the instance has an external IP address assigned.
   - If not, assign an external IP or use **Cloud IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)** for SSH access.
4. **Review Serial Console Logs**:
   - Use the **Serial Console** to check boot logs for errors.
   - Go to **Compute Engine > VM Instances > [Instance Name] > Serial Port**.
5. **Check Network Tags**:
   - Ensure the instance has the correct network tags applied for firewall rules.
6. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use **VPC Network > Connectivity Tests** to diagnose network issues.

## **2. High CPU or Memory Usage**

### **Symptoms**:
- Slow performance or unresponsiveness.
- High CPU or memory usage reported in monitoring.

### **Reasons**:
- Resource-intensive applications or processes.
- Insufficient instance size for the workload.
- Memory leaks or inefficient code.
- Sudden traffic spikes.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Monitoring Metrics**:
   - Use **Cloud Monitoring** to analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage.
   - Look for spikes or sustained high usage.
2. **Identify Resource-Hungry Processes**:
   - SSH into the instance and use commands like `top`, `htop`, or `ps` to identify processes consuming resources.
3. **Resize the Instance**:
   - Stop the instance and resize it to a machine type with more CPU or memory.
4. **Optimize Applications**:
   - Review application logs and configurations for inefficiencies.
5. **Enable Autoscaling**:
   - If applicable, configure instance groups with autoscaling to handle load spikes.

## **3. Boot Issues**

### **Symptoms**:
- Instance fails to boot or gets stuck during boot.
- Error messages in serial console logs.

### **Reasons**:
- Corrupted boot disk.
- Incorrect or missing startup scripts.
- Kernel or OS-level errors.
- Insufficient disk space.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Serial Console Logs**:
   - Go to **Compute Engine > VM Instances > [Instance Name] > Serial Port**.
   - Look for errors related to disk, kernel, or startup scripts.
2. **Verify Boot Disk**:
   - Ensure the boot disk is not corrupted or full.
   - Resize the disk if necessary.
3. **Check Startup Scripts**:
   - Review custom startup scripts for errors.
   - Disable startup scripts temporarily to isolate the issue.
4. **Recreate the Instance**:
   - Create a new instance from the same boot disk or snapshot.
5. **Use Rescue Mode**:
   - Attach the boot disk to another instance as a secondary disk to repair it.

## **4. Disk Performance Issues**

### **Symptoms**:
- Slow read/write operations.
- High disk latency.

### **Reasons**:
- Disk type (e.g., HDD instead of SSD).
- High I/O operations exceeding disk limits.
- Fragmented or overloaded disk.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Disk Metrics**:
   - Use **Cloud Monitoring** to analyze disk I/O and latency.
2. **Resize the Disk**:
   - Larger disks generally have higher performance limits.
3. **Switch Disk Type**:
   - Use SSD (pd-ssd) instead of HDD (pd-standard) for better performance.
4. **Optimize Disk Usage**:
   - Check for excessive disk I/O operations and optimize applications.
5. **Check Disk Quotas**:
   - Ensure you are not hitting disk quota limits.

## **5. Instance Stops Unexpectedly**

### **Symptoms**:
- Instance stops or terminates without user action.

### **Reasons**:
- Preemptible instance termination.
- Resource quota limits exceeded.
- Maintenance events.
- Billing account issues.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Quotas and Limits**:
   - Ensure you are not hitting CPU, memory, or disk quotas.
2. **Review Preemptible Instances**:
   - If using preemptible instances, note that they can be terminated at any time.
3. **Check Maintenance Events**:
   - Go to **Compute Engine > VM Instances > [Instance Name] > Events** to see if the instance was stopped for maintenance.
4. **Review Logs**:
   - Check **Cloud Logging** for any shutdown-related events.
5. **Verify Billing**:
   - Ensure the billing account is active and not suspended.

## **6. SSH Connection Issues**

### **Symptoms**:
- Unable to connect to the instance via SSH.

### **Reasons**:
- Missing or incorrect IAM permissions.
- SSH keys not configured properly.
- Firewall rules blocking SSH traffic.
- Instance not running or misconfigured.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check IAM Permissions**:
   - Ensure the user has the `compute.osLogin` or `compute.instances.use` permission.
2. **Verify SSH Keys**:
   - Check metadata for correct SSH keys under **Compute Engine > Metadata > SSH Keys**.
3. **Use Cloud IAP**:
   - Enable **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** for SSH access if external IP is not available.
4. **Check Firewall Rules**:
   - Ensure firewall rules allow ingress traffic on port 22.
5. **Restart the Instance**:
   - Stop and start the instance to reset network configurations.

## **7. Application Not Running**

### **Symptoms**:
- Application fails to start or crashes.

### **Reasons**:
- Missing dependencies or misconfigurations.
- Port conflicts or binding issues.
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk).
- Application bugs or crashes.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Application Logs**:
   - Use **Cloud Logging** to review application logs.
2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all required dependencies and services are installed and running.
3. **Check Port Bindings**:
   - Ensure the application is binding to the correct port and IP address.
4. **Review Startup Scripts**:
   - Check for errors in custom startup scripts.
5. **Test Locally**:
   - Run the application locally on the instance to isolate the issue.

## **8. Disk Full**

### **Symptoms**:
- Disk usage reaches 100%.
- Applications fail due to lack of disk space.

### **Reasons**:
- Excessive log files or temporary data.
- Unoptimized application storage usage.
- Insufficient disk size for workload.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Disk Usage**:
   - Use `df -h` or `du -sh` to identify large files or directories.
2. **Resize the Disk**:
   - Increase the disk size in the **Compute Engine > Disks** section.
3. **Clear Unnecessary Files**:
   - Delete logs, temporary files, or unused data.
4. **Use Persistent Disks**:
   - Attach additional persistent disks if needed.

## **9. IP Address Issues**

### **Symptoms**:
- Instance loses its external IP address.
- IP address conflicts.

### **Reasons**:
- Ephemeral IP released after instance stop.
- Static IP not reserved or misconfigured.
- IP address quota limits.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check Ephemeral IP**:
   - Ephemeral IPs are released when the instance stops. Use a static IP if needed.
2. **Reserve a Static IP**:
   - Go to **VPC Network > External IP Addresses** and reserve a static IP.
3. **Verify IP Configuration**:
   - Ensure the instance is configured to use the correct IP address.
4. **Check Quotas**:
   - Ensure you are not hitting IP address quotas.

- OS updates or patches not applied.
- Corrupted OS image.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Verify Licensing**:
   - Ensure the correct license is applied for Windows or other licensed OS.
2. **Check OS Updates**:
   - Apply the latest OS updates and patches.
3. **Recreate the Instance**:
   - Create a new instance with a fresh OS image.
