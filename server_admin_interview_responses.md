### 6. How do you check server performance in Windows?

**Good Response:**
"To check server performance in Windows, you can use tools like Task Manager, Performance Monitor, and Resource Monitor. These tools provide insights into CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, and network activity, helping you identify any performance bottlenecks."

**Bad Response:**
"I use Task Manager to see how the server is doing."

### 7. How do you check running processes in Linux?

**Good Response:**
"In Linux, you can check running processes using commands like `ps`, `top`, and `htop`. The `ps` command provides a snapshot of current processes, while `top` and `htop` offer real-time monitoring of system performance and resource usage."

**Bad Response:**
"I use the `ps` command to see what's running."

### 8. What would you do if a server is running slow?

**Good Response:**
"If a server is running slow, I would start by checking the server's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, and network) to identify any bottlenecks. I would also review the running processes to see if any are consuming excessive resources. Additionally, I would check for any recent changes or updates that might have affected performance and ensure that the server is not being affected by malware or other security issues."

**Bad Response:**
"I would restart the server and hope it gets better."
